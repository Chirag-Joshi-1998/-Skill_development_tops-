<!-- Sass @each Directive Example -->
<!-- Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage 
of Sass @each directive. We have an HTML file named 
"simple.html", having the following data. -->

<!-- HTML file: simple.html -->


<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
   <title>@each Directive Example</title>  
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/style.css"/>  
</head>  
<body>  
   <p class="p_pink">This is first paragraph.</p>  
   <p class="p_violet">This is second paragraph.</p>  
   <p class="p_yellow">This is third paragraph.</p>  
   <p class="p_blue">This is fourth paragraph.</p>  
</body>  
</html>   -->


<!-- Create a SCSS file named "simple.scss", having the following data. -->


<!-- SCSS file: simple.scss -->

<!-- @each $color in pink, violet, yellow, blue {  
    .p_#{$color} {  
      background-color: #{$color};  
    }  
  }   -->

<!-- 
Put the both file inside the root folder.

Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to 
tell SASS to watch the file and update the CSS whenever 
SASS file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch simple.scss:./css/style.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "./css/style.css" in the same 
directory automatically. -->


<!-- The created CSS file "./css/style.css" contains the following code: -->
<!-- .p_pink {  
    background-color: pink; }  
  .p_violet {  
    background-color: violet; }  
  .p_yellow {  
    background-color: yellow; }  
  .p_blue {  
    background-color: blue; }   -->
