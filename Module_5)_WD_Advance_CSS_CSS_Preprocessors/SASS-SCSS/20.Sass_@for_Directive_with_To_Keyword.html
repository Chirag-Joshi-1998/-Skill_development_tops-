<!-- Sass @for Directive Example with to keyword -->
<!-- Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage of Sass 
@for directive with to keyword. We have an HTML file named 
"simple.html", having the following data. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
   <title>@for directive example with through keyword</title>  
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/style.css"/>  
</head>  
<body>  
   <p class="p1">Welcome to topsacademy</p>  
   <p class="p2">Welcome to topsacademy</p>  
   <p class="p3">Welcome to topsacademy</p>  
   <p class="p4">Welcome to topsacademy</p>  
   

</body>  
</html>  

<!-- Create a SCSS file named "simple.scss", having the following data. -->

<!-- SCSS file: simple.scss -->

<!-- @for $i from 1 to 4 {  
  .p#{$i} { padding-left : $i * 10px; }  
}    -->

<!-- Put the both file inside the root folder.

Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to 
tell SASS to watch the file and update the CSS whenever 
SASS file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch simple.scss:./css/style.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "./css/style.css" in the same
 directory automatically. -->

<!-- The created CSS file "./css/style.css" contains the following code: -->
<!-- .p1 {  
    padding-left: 10px; }  
  .p2 {  
    padding-left: 20px; }  
  .p3 {  
    padding-left: 30px; }   -->

<!-- Now, execute the above html file, it will read the CSS value. -->
<!-- Now, you can see that padding is done only for 3 statements
 although we use the rule @for $i from 1 to 4 {.

    This is the difference between through and to keyword in @for directive. -->
