<!-- Sass @warn Directive Example -->

<!-- Let's create a SCSS file named "warn.scss", 
 having the following data. -->

<!-- $main-color:  #bdc3c7;  
@warn "Darker: " darken($main-color, 30%);    -->

<!-- 
Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to tell SASS to 
watch the file and update the CSS whenever SASS file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch warn.scss:warn.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "warn.css" in the same 
directory automatically. -->
