<!-- Let's take an example to see the use of if() function in the SCSS file. We have an HTML file named "simple.html" 
having the following code: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
   <title>Sass if() condition example</title>  
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/style.css"/>  
</head>  
<body>  
   <h2>topsacademy: A solution of all technology.</h2>  
</body>  
</html>  
<!-- Create a SCSS file named "simple.scss", 
having the following code: (false condition) -->

<!-- File: simple.scss -->

<!-- h2{  
    color: if( 1 + 1 == 3 , green , red);  
 }   -->


<!-- Put the both file inside the root folder.

Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to 
tell SASS to watch the file and update the CSS whenever SASS
file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch simple.scss:./css/style.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "./css/style.css" in the same 
directory automatically. -->

<!-- The created CSS file "./css/style.css" contains the following code: -->

<!-- h2 {  
    color: red; }   -->


<!-- Note: Here, the created CSS shows the red color because SCSS if condition is false.

Now, execute the above html file, it will read the CSS value. -->


<!-- Create a SCSS file for true condition:

File: simple.scss -->


<!-- h2{  
    color: if( 1 + 1 == 2 , green , red);  
 }   -->


 <!-- It will create the following CSS: -->


 <!-- h2 {  
    color: green; }   -->
