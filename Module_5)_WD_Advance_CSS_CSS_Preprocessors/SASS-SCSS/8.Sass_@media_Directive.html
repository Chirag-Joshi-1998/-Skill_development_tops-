<!-- Sass @media Directive Example -->
<!-- Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage of Sass @media directive with multiple assignments and maps. We have an HTML file named "simple.html", having the following data. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sass @media directive Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body class="container">
    <h2>This is a Sass @media directive example:</h2>
    <img src="../HTML/1.jpg" class="style" />
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Create a SCSS file named "simple.scss", having the following data. -->

<!-- h2{  
    color: violet;  
    }  
    .style{  
    width: 500px;  
    @media screen and (orientation: portrait){  
    width:200px;  
    margin-left: 80px;  
    }  
    }   -->

<!-- Put the both file inside the root folder.

Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to tell SASS to watch the file and update the CSS whenever SASS file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch simple.scss:./css/style.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "./css/style.css" in the same directory automatically. -->

<!-- The created CSS file "./css/style.css" contains the following code: -->
<!-- h2 {  
    color: violet; }  
  .style {  
    width: 500px; }  
    @media screen and (orientation: portrait) {  
      .style {  
        width: 200px;  
        margin-left: 80px; } }   -->
