<!-- Sass @each Directive with multiple assignments -->
<!-- Example -->

<!-- Let's take an example to demonstrate the 
usage of Sass @each directive with multiple assignments.
 We have an HTML file named "simple.html", having the following
  data. -->

<!-- HTML file: simple.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>@each Directive with multiple assignments Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="aqua">This is line one.</p>
    <p class="red">This is line two.</p>
    <p class="green">This is line three.</p>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Create a SCSS file named "simple.scss", having the following data. -->

<!-- SCSS file: simple.scss -->


<!-- @each $color, $border in (aqua, dotted),  
(red, solid),  
(green, double){  
.#{$color} {  
background-color : $color;  
border: $border;  
}  
}   -->

<!-- Put the both file inside the root folder. -->

<!-- Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to
  tell SASS to watch the file and update the CSS whenever 
  SASS file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch simple.scss:./css/style.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "./css/style.css" in the same 
directory automatically. -->

<!-- The created CSS file "./css/style.css" contains the following code: -->

<!-- .aqua {  
    background-color: aqua;  
    border: dotted; }  
  .red {  
    background-color: red;  
    border: solid; }  
  .green {  
    background-color: green;  
    border: double; }   -->


<!-- Now, execute the above html file, it will read the CSS value. -->
