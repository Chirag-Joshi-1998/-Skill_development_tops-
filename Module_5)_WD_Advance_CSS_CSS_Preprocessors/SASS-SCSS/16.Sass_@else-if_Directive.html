<!-- Sass @else-if Directive Example -->



<!-- Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage of Sass @else-if 
directive. We have 
an HTML file named "simple.html", having the following data. -->


<!-- HTML file: simple.html -->


<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
   <title>@if Directive Example</title>  
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/style.css"/>  
</head>  
<body>  
   <div class="container">  
   <h2>Welcome to topsacademy</h2>  
   <p>A solution of all technology. </p>  
   </div>  
</body>  
</html>  


<!-- Create a SCSS file named "simple.scss", having the following data -->
<!-- $type: monster;  
p {  
  @if $type == ocean {  
    color: blue;  
  } @else if $type == matador {  
    color: red;  
  } @else if $type == monster {  
    color: green;  
  } @else {  
    color: black;  
  }  
}   -->


<!-- Put the both file inside the root folder. -->
<!-- Put the both file inside the root folder.

Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to
 tell SASS to watch the file and update the CSS whenever SASS 
 file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch simple.scss:./css/style.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "./css/style.css" in the same 
directory automatically. -->

<!-- The created CSS file "./css/style.css" contains the following code: -->
<!-- p {  
    color: green; }     -->
