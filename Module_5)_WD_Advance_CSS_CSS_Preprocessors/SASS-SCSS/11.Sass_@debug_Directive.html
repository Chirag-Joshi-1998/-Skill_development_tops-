<!-- Sass @debug Directive Example -->

<!-- Let's create a SCSS file named "debug.scss", having the following 
data. -->



<!-- $font-sizes: 10px + 20px;  
$style: (  
  color: #bdc3c7  
);  
.container{  
  @debug $style;  
  @debug $font-sizes;  
}    -->


<!-- Now, open command prompt and run the watch command to tell SASS 
to watch the file and update the CSS whenever SASS file is changed.

Execute the following code: sass --watch debug.scss:debug.css

It will create a normal CSS file named "debug.css" in the same
 directory automatically. -->
