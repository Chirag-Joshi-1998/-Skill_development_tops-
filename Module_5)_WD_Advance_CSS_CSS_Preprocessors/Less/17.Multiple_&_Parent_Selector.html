<!-- Multiple & Example
Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage of multiple & 
parent selectors.

Create a HTML file named "simple.html", having the following data.

strong>HTML file: simple.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Multiple & Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./Css/style.css" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaTpoint: A solution of all technology.</h2>
    <p class="select">
      It is possible to reference the parent selector by using &(ampersand)
      operator.
    </p>
    <p class="select_class1">
      It is possible to reference the parent selector by using &(ampersand)
      operator
    </p>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Now create a file named "simple.less". It is similar to CSS file. The only one difference is that it is saved with ".less" extension. -->

<!-- LESS file: simple.less -->

<!-- .select + .select {  
  color: pink;  
}  
.select .select {  
  color: blue;  
}  
.select.select {  
  color: red;  
}  
.select,  
.select_class1 {  
  color: green;  
}   -->


<!-- The generated CSS "simple.css", has the following code: -->

<!-- .select + .select {  
  color: pink;  
}  
.select .select {  
  color: blue;  
}  
.select.select {  
  color: red;  
}  
.select,  
.select_class1 {  
  color: green;  
}   -->
