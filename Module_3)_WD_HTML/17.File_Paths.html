    <!-- The relative file path specifies to a file which is related
      to the location of current page. -->
    <!-- Example:
    Let's take an example to see how the file path points to a 
    file in the images folder located at the root of the current web. -->

<!-- Important Points for File path: -->
<!-- Always remember to use proper URL, file name, image name, else 
 it will not display on the webpage.
Try to use relative file paths, so that your code will be 
independent of URL. -->
