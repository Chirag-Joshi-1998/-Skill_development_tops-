      The Taj Mahal is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India
      and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
      It is regarded by many as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a
      style that combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman, Turkish and
      Indian architectural styles.
